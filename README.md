HTML elements to focus on while completing a workflow using the LLM

## Parasite Backend Flask App

This Flask app takes a task and prompts the LLM to figure out which HTML elements a user should focus on to complete the task.

The possible extensions is to take it forward and use it so that other people build frontend or extensions and use this data to change how we currently navigate with websites and chatbots.

The idea is to change how we have chatbots in the current ecosysystem.
